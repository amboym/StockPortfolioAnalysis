My idea for this project stems from a mock stock portfolio that i had created in 2017 and recently re-discovered. The Yahoo finance portfolio i have consists of 6 stock Bank of America (BAC), Alphabet/Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVIDIA), AMD (AMD) and Tesla (AMD). Given the heavy reliance on the semiconductor sector for gains, Id like to implement a strategy to diversify the entire portfolio and use the Markowitz Portfolio Theory to determine the optimal stock allocation.
