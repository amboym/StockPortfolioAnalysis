# StockPortfolioAnalysis

## Introduction
DISCLAIMER: I am not an expert on financial topics, this is just a side-project for me to apply topics i have learned in class.

Analyzing stock portfolio, focusing on diversification and determining optimal weights using Modern Portfolio Theory in Python -  markowitz efficient frontier. 
My idea for this project stems from a mock stock portfolio that i had created in 2017 and have recently re-discovered. Here I aim to apply theories and concepts that i learned in my Financial Mathematics class to analyze and optimize the portfolios performance
